# Sudoku
The application will use the Backtracking algorithm technique to build the sudoku board.

I used the article above to create my own algorithm which uses Objects and indexj's to go through and set the board up.  My method is a little easier perhaps because I start off with a completely blank grid that I then update. The plan is to take the grid and only show random fields orginally.  Rather than inserting random fields and then backtracking. I believe this reduces the amount of backtracks thus making the program faster (possibly). 

I used  Durstenfeld shuffle algorithm to shuffle the numbers so that the first row did not start at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.
